## Description

A Google Chrome extension that pauses Spotify playback when a Chrome tab begins playing audio, and resumes playback when there are no longer any tabs playing audio.

## Motivation

I love listening to music, particularly on Spotify, but I also find myself needing to listen to other things, such as a YouTube video. I grew tired of having to find Spotify just to pause my music to listen to something quick, and most times I would end up forgetting to unpause afterwards. I decided to create an extension to do the work for me.

## Installation

Currently pending review on the Chrome Web Store.

## How to use?

Once the extension is installed, click the "Login" button in order to login with Spotify.
Once logged in click the "Control my music" button to allow the extension to start checking your tabs for audio, and playing/pausing your Spotify playback accordingly.
Press the "Stop controlling my music" button when you no longer want to extension to control your playback.
To logout click the "Logout" button
